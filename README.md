## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunications company and develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning. The dataset contains various customer attributes such as contract type, services subscribed, monthly charges, and total charges.

## Project Insights
1. Data Exploration and Analysis
- Explored the distribution of tenure, contract types, and customer services.
- Identified key factors influencing churn, such as tech support, streaming services, and contract duration.
- Model Selection and Evaluation
- Chose Logistic Regression for its interpretability, efficiency, and performance in various scenarios.
- Evaluated model performance on balanced and imbalanced datasets, finding consistent accuracy and precision.
2. Business Recommendations**
- Suggested improvements in tech support, streaming services, and security features to reduce churn.
- Highlighted the importance of contract incentives, automatic payments, and targeted engagement strategies.
